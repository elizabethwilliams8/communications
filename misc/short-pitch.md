Software Carpentry's mission is to teach foundational computing skills to
researchers of all disciplines. Our goal is to help spread skills that both
provide immediate value to research workflows and help learners build a mental
framework for thinking about working collaboratively in open and reproducible
ways. Founded in 1998, we are a non-profit volunteer organization with over 500
instructors in more than 30 countries, who delivered more than 280 hands-on
two-day workshops to over 10,000 learners in 2015 alone. Since 2012, we have
run an instructor training program to introduce workshop alumni to modern
evidence-based teaching methods so that they can pass on skills to peers in
their own research community. The authenticity of an instructor who has come to
these skills based on their own computational challenges increases the impact
of our short workshops. This instructor training program takes two full days in
a classroom plus a half-day of self study before the instructors are asked to
demonstrate competency on one of our lessons to senior instructors in our
community.
